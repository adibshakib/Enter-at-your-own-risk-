This is a basic model of an automated lock system where the key is your FINGERPRINTS. Fortunately, it's pretty tough to lose your fingers so, you will technically never lose your keys. The best part is, you will have 10 different options. Smart, isn't it? So what here happens is, you put your fingerprint on the IR fingerprint sensor, so if the system recognizes your fingerprint, it grants you access and the door opens, with a green light on the liquid display. Or else the display goes red.
